1.First Project-Property Price Prediction
 1. Overview
 This project focuses on predicting property prices in various districts of California using
 several district-level features. By building a predictive model, we aim to identify key variables
 that influence housing prices and improve the accuracy of house value predictions. The
 project will specifically utilize simple linear regression and multiple linear regression to
 address this regression task, ensuring proper data handling and evaluation of the models.
 2. Problem Statement
 The objective is to predict the median house value in California districts based on features
 such as income, the number of rooms, geographical location, and proximity to the ocean.
 Given the dataset, we will develop regression models, evaluate their performance, and
 determine which model provides the best balance between predictive accuracy and
 interpretability.

2. Second Project- Part B: Customer Churn Prediction
 1. Overview
 Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to when a customer ceases their relationship
 with a company or service provider. In today's highly competitive business environment,
 retaining customers is a critical factor for long-term success. Predicting customer churn can
 help organizations take proactive steps to retain customers, thus minimizing revenue loss.
 This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will
 churn based on their demographic, account, and service-related data.
 2. Problem Statement
 The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer
 will churn. Using demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure), along
 with information about the services they use (such as internet service, phone service, and
 online security), we will attempt to build a model that helps the company identify customers
 who are at a high risk of churning.
 By predicting customer churn, the company can proactively design retention strategies to
 keep these customers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing financial loss.

 precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).
 ● A final report explaining the insights gained from the model and the business
 implications of customer churn prediction.
 5. Success Criteria
 The success of the project will be determined by the following:
 ● Proper interpretation of the model’s output, providing actionable insights to reduce
 customer churn.
 ● Get thepredictions for the new data.

3.Third Project- Early disease detection
Part C: Early Disease Detection
 1. Overview
 Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including heart disease, are the leading cause of death
 worldwide. Early detection of heart disease is critical for preventing serious health outcomes
 and improving the quality of life for patients. With the increasing availability of medical data,
 machine learning models can be used to predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart
 disease based on certain health indicators.
 In this project, you will build a classification model to predict whether an individual is likely to
 have heart disease or not. The dataset provided includes various health and demographic
 factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking
and alcohol consumption). The goal is to train a model to identify which individuals have
 heart disease based on these features.
 2. Problem Statement
 You are provided with a dataset that contains health-related information about individuals.
 Your task is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart
 disease based on the provided features. The target variable in the dataset is "disease,"
 which indicates whether a person has heart disease (1) or not (0).
 You need to perform the following tasks:
 Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Understand the dataset, handle missing values,
 perform feature engineering if necessary, and prepare the data for model training.
 Model Development: Train a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease
 using the features provided in the dataset.
 Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate classification metrics
 such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Identify the best-performing model based
 on these metrics.
 Insights and Reporting: Analyze the results and provide insights into which factors are the
 most significant predictors of heart disease.

 4. Deliverables
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of the
 variables, check for missing data, and identify any relationships or patterns between the
 features and the target variable (disease).
 Data Preprocessing: Handle missing or erroneous values, normalize/standardize data if
 necessary, and perform feature engineering if required.
 Model Development: Train various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision
 Trees, SVM, etc.) and compare their performance.
 Mode Evaluation: l Evaluate your models using performance metrics such as:
 ● Accuracy
 ● Precision
 ● Recall
 ● F1-Score
 Insights and Conclusion: Based on your model and analysis, provide insights into the
 factors that are most predictive of heart disease and make recommendations on how to
 improve heart disease prediction models

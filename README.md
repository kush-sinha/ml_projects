1.First Project-Property Price Prediction
 1. Overview
 This project focuses on predicting property prices in various districts of California using
 several district-level features. By building a predictive model, we aim to identify key variables
 that influence housing prices and improve the accuracy of house value predictions. The
 project will specifically utilize simple linear regression and multiple linear regression to
 address this regression task, ensuring proper data handling and evaluation of the models.
 2. Problem Statement
 The objective is to predict the median house value in California districts based on features
 such as income, the number of rooms, geographical location, and proximity to the ocean.
 Given the dataset, we will develop regression models, evaluate their performance, and
 determine which model provides the best balance between predictive accuracy and
 interpretability.

 4. Deliverables
 ● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations and summary statistics.
 ● Data Preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical
 variables.
 ● Modeldevelopment using:
 o Simple Linear Regression
 o Multiple Linear Regression
 ● Evaluation of the models using relevant metrics (Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall,
 F1-Score, etc.) where applicable.
 ● A final, well-documented notebook detailing all steps, insights, and the final model
 selection.
 5. Success Criteria
 ● Themodelshould have a high degree of accuracy and balance with interpretability.
● The evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE and R Square will be used to measure
 the model’s performance.
 ● Ensure proper documentation of all steps, and present visualizations that help
 explain the data and model outcomes.
 6. Guidelines
 ● Makesureto split your data into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting.
 ● Tunethe hyperparameters of your models to improve performance.
 ● Report all the steps taken in the data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
 phases.
 ● Provide a final model that balances accuracy with interpretability

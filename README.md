1.First Project-Property Price Prediction
 1. Overview
 This project focuses on predicting property prices in various districts of California using
 several district-level features. By building a predictive model, we aim to identify key variables
 that influence housing prices and improve the accuracy of house value predictions. The
 project will specifically utilize simple linear regression and multiple linear regression to
 address this regression task, ensuring proper data handling and evaluation of the models.
 2. Problem Statement
 The objective is to predict the median house value in California districts based on features
 such as income, the number of rooms, geographical location, and proximity to the ocean.
 Given the dataset, we will develop regression models, evaluate their performance, and
 determine which model provides the best balance between predictive accuracy and
 interpretability.

 4. Deliverables
 ● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations and summary statistics.
 ● Data Preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical
 variables.

 F1-Score, etc.) where applicable.
 ● A final, well-documented notebook detailing all steps, insights, and the final model
 selection.
 5. Success Criteria
 ● Themodelshould have a high degree of accuracy and balance with interpretability.
● The evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE and R Square will be used to measure
 the model’s performance.
 ● Ensure proper documentation of all steps, and present visualizations that help
 explain the data and model outcomes.
 6. Guidelines
 ● Makesureto split your data into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting.
 ● Tunethe hyperparameters of your models to improve performance.
 ● Report all the steps taken in the data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
 phases.
 ● Provide a final model that balances accuracy with interpretability    
2. Second Project- Part B: Customer Churn Prediction
 1. Overview
 Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to when a customer ceases their relationship
 with a company or service provider. In today's highly competitive business environment,
 retaining customers is a critical factor for long-term success. Predicting customer churn can
 help organizations take proactive steps to retain customers, thus minimizing revenue loss.
 This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will
 churn based on their demographic, account, and service-related data.
 2. Problem Statement
 The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer
 will churn. Using demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure), along
 with information about the services they use (such as internet service, phone service, and
 online security), we will attempt to build a model that helps the company identify customers
 who are at a high risk of churning.
 By predicting customer churn, the company can proactively design retention strategies to
 keep these customers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing financial loss.

The information related to variables given can be found in the Data Information.pdf.
 4. Deliverables
 ● Adata exploration and preprocessing notebook or report that analyzes the dataset,
 handles missing values, and prepares the data for modeling.
 ● Amachinelearning model capable of predicting customer churn.
 ● An evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics (such as accuracy,
 precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).
 ● A final report explaining the insights gained from the model and the business
 implications of customer churn prediction.
 5. Success Criteria
 The success of the project will be determined by the following:
 ● Proper interpretation of the model’s output, providing actionable insights to reduce
 customer churn.
 ● Get thepredictions for the new data.
 6. Guidelines
 ● Makesureto split your data into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting.
 ● Tunethe hyperparameters of your models to improve performance.
 ● Report all the steps taken in the data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
 phases.
 ● Provide a final model that balances accuracy with interpretability.
